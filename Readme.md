# Lab 05 - Flag

## Lab Goal
This lab was designed to give you more practice using loops, nested loops, and if statements.

## Instructions
You are going to be making the flag of your country using ASCII characters.

Requirements:
* Should be at least 20x30 characters in size.
* Must have more than one pattern (for example, the USA flag has the stripes part and the stars part).
* Must have a border (see sample output below).
* Must use nested loops and if statements to build the pattern.
* Each `print` or `println` statement can only output one character at a time.
* Come up with a name for your country and include that in the output.
* Copy and paste your output into the Readme.md file in the appropriate place below.

## Sample output
(note that this only has one pattern so it doesn't meet all of the requirements)
```

|\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
| \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \|
|\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
| \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \|
|\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
| \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \|

```

## Your Flag
```
paste your country name and flag here
It needs to be between the lines of \`\`\` for proper formatting
```

## Notes
* The Checkstyle config url is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* Make sure you modify the link at the top of your **Readme.md** to reflect your username if you want the badge at the top to represent the status of your code.



## Grading
* 90 - a quality flag that meets the criteria
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
